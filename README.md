# Joe Wroten's Dotfiles
Develop using just the terminal with the very best tools. iTerm2, NeoVim, The Silver Searcher, FuzzyFinder, Dein, and more!

> Inspired by [Toran B.](https://twitter.com/toranb) 's dotfiles who got me started with my modern workflow.ðŸ’™

## Please Note
This is intended to set up a developers environment from the ground up.

Running `init.sh` will **replace** your bash_profile, vim/NeoVim settings, tmux settings, and ag settings. _Run at your own risk._

## Install

Be sure your Xcode and Xcode command line tools are installed and up to date.

1. Get Dein Installer `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shougo/dein.vim/master/bin/installer.sh > ~/dein-installer/installer.sh`
2. Install Dein`sh ~/dein-installer/installer.sh ~/.dein`
3. Install Other Tools `brew install git tmux ag fzf neovim/neovim/neovim`
4. Get This Repo `git clone git@github.com:sharpshark28/dotfiles.git ~/dotfilez`
5. Run Init `bash ~/dotfilez/init.sh`
6. restart terminal

Get started in your project dir with `nvim` and enjoy!

## Tips

### Vim/NeoVim Stuffs

* Leader is `<Space>`
* Navigate Buffers
  * Next buffer `<Tab>`
  * Previous buffer `<Shift> + <Tab>`
  * Reopen last file `<Space> <Space>`
* Mouse support is disabled
  * (can be enabled in NeoVim with iTerm2 by setting `set mouse=a`)
* Nerdtree (file tree)
  * Toggle `<Space> d`
  * Open from current file `<Space> D`
* Sneak
  * `f{char}{char}` sneaks forward
  * `F{char}{char}` sneaks backward
* Ag (The Silver Searcher)
  * `<Space> a`
* Fuzzy File Finder
  * `<Space> ff`
* Linting happens on file safe
  * TODO Soon this will happen live!
  * Use NeoVim if you want this to be async
